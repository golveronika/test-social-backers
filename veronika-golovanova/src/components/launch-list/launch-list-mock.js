			"SpaceX's sixteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Telstar 18V / APStar 5C to GTO for Telesat and APStar. Telesat signed a contract with SSL in December 2015 for the construction of the satellite. It is based on the SSL-1300 bus with an electrical output of approximately 14 kW. The new satellite will operate from 138° East and significantly expand Telesat’s capacity over the Asia Pacific region through a combination of broad regional beams and high throughput spot-beams. Telesat also announced it has entered into an agreement with APT Satellite Company Limited (APSTAR) under which APSTAR will make use of capacity on Telstar-18-VANTAGE to serve its growing base of customers. This agreement extends the long term relationship between APSTAR and Telesat that has existed for more than a decade. Equipped with C and Ku-band transponders, Telstar 18 VANTAGE will offer superior performance for broadcasters, telecom service providers and enterprise networks on the ground, in the air and at sea. Its broad C-band coverage will extend across the Asia region to Hawaii enabling direct connectivity between any point in Asia and the Americas. Its Ku-band capacity will expand on Telesat’s coverage of growing satellite service markets in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean.",

			"SpaceX's sixteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Telstar 18V / APStar 5C to GTO for Telesat and APStar. Telesat signed a contract with SSL in December 2015 for the construction of the satellite. It is based on the SSL-1300 bus with an electrical output of approximately 14 kW. The new satellite will operate from 138° East and significantly expand Telesat’s capacity over the Asia Pacific region through a combination of broad regional beams and high throughput spot-beams. Telesat also announced it has entered into an agreement with APT Satellite Company Limited (APSTAR) under which APSTAR will make use of capacity on Telstar-18-VANTAGE to serve its growing base of customers. This agreement extends the long term relationship between APSTAR and Telesat that has existed for more than a decade. Equipped with C and Ku-band transponders, Telstar 18 VANTAGE will offer superior performance for broadcasters, telecom service providers and enterprise networks on the ground, in the air and at sea. Its broad C-band coverage will extend across the Asia region to Hawaii enabling direct connectivity between any point in Asia and the Americas. Its Ku-band capacity will expand on Telesat’s coverage of growing satellite service markets in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean.",

			"SpaceX's sixteenth mission of 2018 will be the launch of Telstar 18V / APStar 5C to GTO for Telesat and APStar. Telesat signed a contract with SSL in December 2015 for the construction of the satellite. It is based on the SSL-1300 bus with an electrical output of approximately 14 kW. The new satellite will operate from 138° East and significantly expand Telesat’s capacity over the Asia Pacific region through a combination of broad regional beams and high throughput spot-beams. Telesat also announced it has entered into an agreement with APT Satellite Company Limited (APSTAR) under which APSTAR will make use of capacity on Telstar-18-VANTAGE to serve its growing base of customers. This agreement extends the long term relationship between APSTAR and Telesat that has existed for more than a decade. Equipped with C and Ku-band transponders, Telstar 18 VANTAGE will offer superior performance for broadcasters, telecom service providers and enterprise networks on the ground, in the air and at sea. Its broad C-band coverage will extend across the Asia region to Hawaii enabling direct connectivity between any point in Asia and the Americas. Its Ku-band capacity will expand on Telesat’s coverage of growing satellite service markets in China, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Ocean.",
